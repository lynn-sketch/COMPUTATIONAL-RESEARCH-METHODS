   abstract = {The world is currently striving to achieve the globally adopted sustainable development goals (SDGs). Exploring the role of technology in achieving the SDGs is critical for the decision-makers and will allow them to overcome any possible trade-off. In this work, the role of wastewater management in achieving the SDGs has been indicated. The analysis shows that wastewater treatment could contribute to achieving 11 out of 17 SDGs. The major contribution came from its ability to increase water availability (SDG 2: zero hunger and SDG 6: clean water and sanitation), enhance human health worldwide (SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing), providing a new source of income for smallholder (SDG 1: no poverty and SDG 8: decent work and economic growth), converting waste to energy (SDG 7: affordable and clean energy, and SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure) and reducing the environmental impact of wastewater (SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12: responsible consumption and production, SDG 13: climate action, and SDG 14: life below water). The challenges related to implementing and assessing these targets were discussed as well. A set of indicators (guideline) were proposed to improve the contribution of the wastewater treatment facility to the SDGs. This study emphasizes on the significant influence of wastewater treatment on the United Nations' SDGs and targets worldwide.},

   abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays diverse roles in fisheries governance: it gathers and disseminates data and information; it serves as a forum for States to develop and adopt treaties and soft-law instruments; and it monitors the implementation of some of these instruments. Several of these functions rely on transparency, by the FAO or by States towards it. Beyond its specific role in relation to data sharing, transparency is a good governance principle contributing to accountability and enabling participation. This article examines how transparent the FAO is in its operations related to fisheries. The FAO was an early adopter of some aspects of sound practice in its approach to transparency, but now appears behind the curve: it lacks an access to information policy and its access to meetings policy does not account for treaty negotiations happening outside of governing body meetings. As a clearing house mechanism, the FAO is quite efficient but nevertheless could be clearer as to whether required information has been provided by States and why some information is restricted. Finally, as an entity monitoring the implementation of instruments, the FAO has developed an increasingly detailed naming and shaming technique to encourage States to respond to its requests for information. However, beyond this information on the identity of responders and some general aggregated data on the substance of the response, very little is made public. As States are acting towards the public interest through the FAO, it is hard to defend opacity in such matters.},
